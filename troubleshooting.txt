# Troubleshooting Guide for Stock Analyzer

This guide helps you resolve common issues that may occur while installing or running the Stock Analyzer app.

---

## ‚ùå Issue: "ModuleNotFoundError"

### Error Message:
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'streamlit'


### Solution:
This means a required package is not installed. Install it using pip:
```bash
pip install streamlit

Replace *streamlit* with any other missing package name if needed.

---

## ‚ùå Issue: "ValueError" or Shape Errors

### Error Message:
ValueError: Found array with dim 3. None expected <= 2.


### Solution:
This happens due to improper array reshaping. Ensure any model input/output is reshaped like:
.reshape(-1, 1)

If you're modifying the code, double-check reshaping before using *inverse_transform().*

## ‚ùå Issue: Streamlit App Not Opening in Browser

## Cause:
Sometimes the browser doesn‚Äôt open automatically.


### Solution:
Check the terminal for a local URL (e.g., http://localhost:8501) and open it manually in your browser.

Make sure no other app is using port 8501. You can change the port using:
streamlit run stock-analyzer.py --server.port 8502

## ‚ùå Issue: "KeyError" for Missing Columns

### Error Message:
KeyError: 'High'


### Solution:
This means a column you're trying to access does not exist in the dataset.
Make sure your fetch_stock_data() function retrieves valid stock data.

Check column names using:
print(data.columns)

and adjust accordingly.

## ‚ùå Issue: App Won‚Äôt Load Data

### Cause:

üõ† General Tips
- Use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts:
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
env\Scripts\activate     # On Windows

- Always install required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

- Use *print()* or *st.write()* statements to debug.
